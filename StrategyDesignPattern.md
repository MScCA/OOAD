# Strategy Design Pattern

***
### When to use Strategy Pattern
-	 You use this pattern if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time.
-	 The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses. It is a super design pattern and is often the first one taught.
