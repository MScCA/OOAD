# Iterator Design Pattern

***
### What is Iterator Pattern
-	The Iterator Pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of Objects
-	If you get an Array, ArrayList, Hashtable of Objects, you pop out an Iterator for each and treat them the same
-	This provides an uniform way to cycle through different collections
-	You can also write polymorphic code because you can refer to each collection of objects because they will implement the same interface
