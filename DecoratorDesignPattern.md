# Decorator Design Pattern

***
### What is Decorator Design Pattern
-	The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically
-	You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time
-	It is more flexible than inheritance
-	Simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes
-	Rather than rewrite old code you can extend with new code
