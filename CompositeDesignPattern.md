# Composite Design Pattern

***
### What is Composite Pattern
-	Allows you to treat individual object and composition of objects uniformly
-	They allow you to represent part-whole hierarchies
	-	Components can be further divided into smaller components
-	You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole object individually

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
The Composite Pattern allows us to build structures of objects  in the form of trees that contain both compositions of objects and individual objects as nodes.
Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations over both composites and individual objects. In other words., in most cases we can ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects.
