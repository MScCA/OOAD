# Mediator Design Pattern

***
### What is Mediator Pattern
-	It is used to handle communication between related objects (Colleagues)
-	All communication is handled by the Mediator and the Colleagues don't need to know anything about each other
-	GOF : Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way disparate sets of objects interact and communicate with each other. Allows for the actions of each objects set to vary independently of one another.
