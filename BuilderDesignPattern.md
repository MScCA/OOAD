# Builder Design Pattern

### What is Builder Pattern
-	Pattern used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects
	-	When you want to build an object made up from other objects
	-	When you want the creation of these parts to be independent of the main object
	-	Hide the creation of the parts from the client so both aren't dependent
	-	The builder knows the specifics and nobody else does
