# Singleton Design Pattern

***
### What is Singleton Pattern
-	It is used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating of more than one object
-	I'll demonstrate it using a class that holds all the potential Scrabble letters and spits out new upon request
	-	Each player will share the same potential letter list
	-	Each player has their own set of letters
